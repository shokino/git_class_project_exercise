Pere Lachaise Cemetery

(from https://en.wikipedia.org)

Père Lachaise Cemetery (French: Cimetière du Père-Lachaise, 
formerly, cimetière de l'Est, "East Cemetery") is the largest cemetery
in the city of Paris (44 hectares or 110 acres),[1] though there are larger
cemeteries in the city's suburbs.

Père Lachaise is in the 20th arrondissement and is notable for being the first
garden cemetery, as well as the first municipal cemetery.[2] It is also the
site of three World War I memorials.

The cemetery is on Boulevard de Mènilmontant. The Paris Métro station Philippe
Auguste on line 2 is next to the main entrance, while the station called Père
Lachaise, on both lines 2 and 3, is 500 metres away near a side entrance that
has been closed to the public. Many tourists prefer the Gambetta station on
line 3, as it allows them to enter near the tomb of Oscar Wilde and then walk
downhill to visit the rest of the cemetery.

Each year, Père Lachaise Cemetery welcomes over 3.5 million visitors, making it
the most visited cemetery in the world.
