Wolf Spider

(from https://en.wikipedia.org)

Hogna ingens, the Deserta Grande wolf spider, is a critically endangered spider
species endemic to the Deserta Grande Island of the Madeira archipelago -
specifically a remote valley, the Vale de Castalheira. Adult numbers have been
estimated at less than 5,000, making it one of the rarest wolf spider species.
It is also believed to be one of the largest wolf spiders on earth, with a 12
cm (4.7 in) leg span for the female, somewhat smaller for the male (the Latin
ingens means "huge" or "monstrous"). Coloration is grey and black with white
spots on the legs. The spider hides under rocks and crevices on this volcanic
island, but its habitat is being invaded by the grass Phalaris aquatica,[2]
while the native vegetation is damaged by introduced goats and rabbits.[3] The
spider preys on smaller relatives, millipedes and other insects, and even small
lizards.[4] It is capable of delivering a painful and venomous bite to
humans.[5]
