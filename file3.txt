Parc de Belleville

(from https://en.wikipedia.org)

The Parc de Belleville is located on the hill of Belleville, its 108 metres
making it the highest park in Paris. At the summit of the park, an almost
thirty-metre tall terrace provides a panoramic view of the city. The park was
conceived by the architect François Debulois and the landscaper Paul Brichet.
It was inaugurated in 1988.

The park offers 1200 trees and shrubs, a 100-metre-long waterfall fountain (the
longest in Paris), and 1000 m² of lawn accessible to the public. It also
contains a wooden playground for children, ping-pong tables and an open-air
theatre. At the top of the park lies the Maison de l'Air, a small museum
designed to educate visitors to the importance of fresh air and to the problems
of pollution.

The park also prides itself on its display of annual flowers. The gardeners
prepare the flower beds two years in advance, in tight collaboration with the
horticultural center of Rungis. Their compositions have received prizes
numerous times at the Concours des Décorations Florales Estivales (Summer
Floral Decoration Competition), which takes place each year in September.[
